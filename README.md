# Project TREADS

**TREADS** stands for **T**ry, **R**ealize and **E**xplore **A**lgorithms and **D**ata **S**tructures

## About

I like solving problems, irrespective of the nature and extent of the problem. As a Computer Science undergraduate student, I was introduced to programming problems in a course [module](https://nusmods.com/modules/CS2040S/data-structures-and-algorithms). And ever since, solving problems with code while listening to lofi music has been my go-to productive pastime.

Initiated on 04th March, 2021, the aim of Project TREADS is to learn, understand, practice and explore theoretical knowledge and practical skills in the concepts of **Algorithms and Data Structures**.

This repo contains **MY** version of solutions to algorithmic and competitive programming problems from platforms like LeetCode, CODECHEF and Codeforces. The solutions are written in **Java**, **C++** and **Python**. All solutions in the repo are free to use and learn from, with their corresponding questions of the same name available on the specified platform.

## Tech

- [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) - Written in Javaâ„¢ SE Development Kit 11.0.9 (JDK 11.0.9)

- [IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows) - An IDE for Java

- [C++](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/14) - Written in C++ 14

- [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/download/#section=windows) - A cross-platform IDE for C and C++

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) - Written in Python 3.10.2

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - An open-source code editor

## Usage

1. Open the platform-based directory of your choice.
2. Navigate through lexicographically distributed sub-directories.
3. Open the directory with the same name as the problem of your choice.
4. Inside the directory,
   - the `src` sub-directory would contain appropriately named **Java** solution and (occasionally) test files.
   - `Solution.cpp` would contain the **C++** solution.
   - `Solution.py` would contain the the **Python** solution.

**Note:**

- Solutions in this repo might not always be the fastest or most efficient in terms of space usage.
- My solution to any of the included problems is just one way of solving the problem and is not the only right way to solve it.
- You might find likeness between the solutions in this repo and other openly available solutions on the internet. This could be a result of me taking inspiration/help from similar solutions or just sheer coincidence.
