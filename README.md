**TREADS** stands for  **T**ry, **R**ealize and **E**xplore **A**lgorithms and **D**ata **S**tructures

## About

I like solving problems, irrespective of the nature and extent of the problem. As a Computer Science undergraduate student, I was introduced to programming problems in  a course [module](https://nusmods.com/modules/CS2040S/data-structures-and-algorithms). And ever since, solving problems with code while listening to lofi music has been my go-to productive pastime.

Initiated on 04th March, 2021, the aim of Project TREADS is to learn, understand, practice and explore theoretical knowledge and practical skills in the concepts of **Algorithms and Data Structures**.

This repo contains **MY** version of solutions to algorithmic and competitive programming problems from platforms like LeetCode and CODECHEF. The solutions are written entirely in **Java**. All solutions in the repo are free to use and learn from, with their corresponding questions of the same name available on the specified platform.

## Stats

- Beginning on 04th March, 2021, this project is currently in progress with over 100+ hours of active problem solving and coding. 

- Over 200+ problems solved on LeetCode - [profile](https://leetcode.com/Ketan_Yeluri/)
	- 90+ are of Easy level difficulty with an acceptance rate of 90+ %
	- 100+ are of Medium level difficulty with an acceptance rate of 90+ %
	- 10+ are of Hard level difficulty with an acceptance rate of 90+ %
	- 60+ day streak for Daily Coding Challenge

- About 50 problems solved on CODECHEF - [profile](https://www.codechef.com/users/yeluriketan)
	- Participated in 12+ Competitive Programming Contests

## Tech

-  [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) - Written in Javaâ„¢ SE Development Kit 11.0.9 (JDK 11.0.9)

-  [IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows) - Text editor for Java

## Usage

1. Open the platform-based directory of you choice
2. Navigate through lexicographically distributed sub-directories.
3. Open the directory with the same name as the problem of your choice.
4. Inside the `src` directory, you'll be able to find the appropriately named solution files.
5. Some problems also contain a `Test` driver file for testing purposes.

**Note:** 
* Solutions in this repo might not always be the fastest or most efficient in terms of space usage.
* My solution to any of the included problems is just one way of solving the problem and is not the only right way to solve it.
* You might find likeness between the solutions in this repo and other openly available solutions on the internet. This could be a result of me taking inspiration/help from similar solutions or just sheer coincidence.
