## _My First 100 Leetcode Problems_

## What Is [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/explore/)?

> It’s a website where people–mostly software engineers–practice their coding skills. There are 2000+ questions (and growing), each with multiple solutions. Questions are ranked by level of difficulty: easy, medium, and hard.

## What is this repo?

> This repo contains **MY** solutions to the first 100 problems I have attempted on LeetCode. The problems are heavily based on the concepts of **Algorithms and Data Structures** and the solutions are written entirely in **Java**. All solutions in the repo are free to use and learn from, with their corresponding questions of the same name on the LeetCode platform.
